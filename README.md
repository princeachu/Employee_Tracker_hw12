# Employee Tracker

[![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm%20-inquirer-blue)]

## Project Description

Employee tracker is a backend application that allows a user to manage an emploee database created using MySQL. Utilizing the application the user will be able to add and remove an employee's information from the system. You can add what department they work in, their employee role and salary as well as their role and department Id. I accomplished this by utilizing MySQL to store the data and node.js and inquirer to prompt the user on what information they would like to add, remove and view.
